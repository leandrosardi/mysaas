## 8. Email Notifications

For every **notification** that you want to setup, you have to create a file in the folder `notifications` of your **MySaaS**'s extension. 

The **Notifications** module of **MySaaS** has the following features:

1. Setting Notification.
2. Delivering Trigger Notifications.
3. Delivering FollowUp Notifications.
4. Testing FollowUp Conditions.
5. Delivering Test Emails.
6. Tracking Opens.
7. Tracking Clicks.

### 8.1. Setting Notification

For every **notification** that you want to setup, you have to create a file in the folder `notifications` of your **MySaaS**'s extension. 

Example: the file `~/code/mysaas/notifications/confirm.rb` has this code.

```ruby
# Notification to deliver when a new user signups, or a new user is added to an exisitng account.
module BlackStack
  module MySaaS
    class NotificationConfirm < BlackStack::MySaaS::Notification 
      LINK_TIMEOUT = 18

      def initialize(i_user)
        super(i_user)
        self.type = 2
      end
      
      def subject_template
        "Confirm Your Email Address."
      end

      def body_template
        " 
          <p>Dear #{self.user.name.encode_html},</p>

          <p>We sent this email to you becuase you created an account in <a href='#{CS_HOME_WEBSITE}'><b>#{APP_NAME}</b></a>.</p>

          <p><b>Click the link below to confirm your email address.</b></p>
          
          <p>This link will be valid for #{BlackStack::MySaaS::NotificationConfirm::LINK_TIMEOUT.to_s} minutes.</p>
          
          <p><a href='#{CS_HOME_WEBSITE}/confirm/#{self.id.to_guid}'><b>Click here and confirm your email address</b></a>.</p>
          
          <br/>
          
          <p>Email address confirmation is a neccesary step to unlock most of the #{APP_NAME} features.</p>
          <p>If the link above is no longer available, you can request a new confirmation link <a href='#{CS_HOME_WEBSITE}/settings/users'><b>here</b></a>.</p>
        "
      end
    end
  end # module MySaaS
end # module BlackStack
```

### 8.2. Delivering Trigger Notifications

A **trigger notification** happens when the user performs any specific action.

Examples:

- When the user signups, you send him a welcome email.

- When the user request a report, you send him an email with a link for email address verification.
(Our native class `NotificationConfirm` does that).

To delivering **trigger notifications** you just have to add a line in your source code, just where there trigger event happens.

```ruby
BlackStack::MySaaS::NotificationConfirm.new(u).do
```

### 8.3. Delivering FollowUp Notifications

A **followup notification** is more like a marketing email that you deliver to remind the user to take some action.

Example:

- You send a weekly email about new seminars in your education platform.

- You send a daily email with a summary of new posts of fellow community members.

A **followup notification** can be setting in `config.rb` file of your **MySaaS**'s extension.

```ruby
# When client has accounts, but 0 pipelines created.
# This happens very often when a client paid for service, we assigned accounts, but the client didn't submit his requirement.
BlackStack::MySaaS::Notifications.add_followup({
    'name' => 'leads.didnt-create-search',
    'description' => "New account signed up, but it did't create a any search yet.",
    # what is the notification to deliver
    'notification' => BlackStack::Leads::NotificationNoSearch
    # what is the condition to deliver this notification to a user.
    'condition' => Proc.new do |user, *args|
        # use must be the owner of the account
        object.lnusers.size > 0 &&
        object.pipelines.size == 0 
    end,
    # how ofter should I repeat this process.
    'repeat_notification' => true, 
    'repeat_notification_units' => 1,
    'repeat_notification_period' => 'day', 
    'repeat_times' => -1, # -1: repeat forever, 0: never deliver, >0: stop after # notifications.  
})
```

### 8.4. Testing FollowUp Conditions

The command below will test the condition of each follow, for all the active users; and it will return a report about this. 

```bash
cd ~/code/mysaas/cli
ruby ./followups.rb
```

If you want to test one specific followup, use the parameter `name=`

```bash
ruby ./followups.rb name=leads.didnt-create-search
```

If you want to test for one specific user, use the parameter `email=`

```bash
ruby ./followups.rb email=leandro.sardi@expandedventure.com
```

If you also want to deliver such a followups, use the parameter `do=`

```bash
ruby ./followups.rb do=yes
```
