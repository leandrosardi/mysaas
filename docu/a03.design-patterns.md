# a03. Design Patterns

A **design pattern** systematically names, motivates, and explains a general design that addresses a recurring desing problem in object-oriented systems. It describes the problem, the solution, when to apply the solution, and its consequences. It also gives implementation hints and examples [1](https://people.cs.vt.edu/~kafura/cs2704/design.patterns.html).

This tutorial introduces the typical design problems we face when develop MySaaS's extensions, and a standard solution to resolve them. 

## a03.1. Filters

You have a web form (account.erb) to update some information regarding the account.

The information submited by the user is pushed to another page called **filter**.
The filter is a pure-erb file, whith no HTML. Only Ruby code is present in the **filter**.

**account.erb**
```html
<form class="form-horizontal" action="filter_account" method="post">
	<div class="control-group span12">
		<label class="control-label" for="inputKeywords">Company Name</label>
		<div class="controls">
			<input type="text" class="input-xlarge" name="company_name" id="company_name" placeholder="Write your Company to be used for the invoicing" value="<%=account.name.encode_html%>">
		</div>
		<br/>							
		<div class="controls">
			<button type="submit" id="update" class="btn btn-blue">Update</button>
			<a id="cancel" class="btn btn-default" href='/settings'>Cancel</a>
		</div>
	</div>
</form>
```

**filter_account.erb**
```ruby
<%
account = @login.user.account
company_name = params[:company_name]

# validate: company_name is required
if company_name.to_s.size==0
	redirect "/settings/account?err=#{CGI::escape("Company Name is Required.")}"
end

# validate: company_name cannot be longer then 100 characters
if company_name.to_s.size>100
	redirect "/settings/account?err=#{CGI::escape("Company Name cannot be longer then 100 characters.")}"
end

# save
account.name = company_name
account.id_timezone = id_timezone
account.save

redirect "/settings/account?msg=#{CGI::escape("Information Updated.")}"
%>
```

Both `account.erb` and `filter_account.erb` are defined in the `app.rb` file:

**app.rb**
```ruby
# account information
get '/settings/account', :auth => true, :agent => /(.*)/ do
  erb :'views/settings/account', :layout => :'/views/layouts/core'
end

post '/settings/filter_account', :auth => true do
  erb :'views/settings/filter_account'
end
```

Some considerations:

1. The `auth` condition requires a logged in user to access these pages, but also generates the `@login` object, from where you can grab the logged in user.

2. The `:layout => :'/views/layouts/core'` embbeds the code of `account.erb` into another **HTML template** who includes the topbar, the leftbar, the footer, and the invokes of all the required stylsheets and javascript files.

3. The same **HTML tamplate** process the GET parameters `?err=` and `?msg=` returned by `filter_account.erb`, and show them in the screen.
