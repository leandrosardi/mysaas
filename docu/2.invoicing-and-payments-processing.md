## 2. Installing Modules

**my-free-membership-site** is extensible. That means, you can install 3th parties modules to add features like payments processing; or any other module regarding the kind of product that you want to develop like e-commerce, online stores, software-as-a-service, education, social networks, etc.

If the module you need doesn't exists, you can create your own modules too.

Installing a module is as simple as running a Ruby script:

```bash
cd ~/my-free-membership-site
ruby ./add.rb name=<module name>
```
