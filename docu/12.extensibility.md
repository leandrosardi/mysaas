# 12. Extensibility

This section is about how to write extensions.

## 12.1. Folders Structure

Basically, an extension is a folder structure that is appended to the **mySaaS** folder.

```ruby
BlackStack::Extensions::appened(:helpdesk)
# this line will append all the subfolders into ~/code/helpdesk to ~/code/mysaas
```

The folder structure is well defined [here](./a01.folders.md).


You can also define the working folder where all your extensions are placed.

```ruby
BlackStack::Extensions::set_path '~/code'
```

## 12.2. Extension Descriptors

Any extension have a file `.extension` in its root path, with a hash descriptor.

```ruby
BlackStack::Extensions::add(
    # descriptive name and descriptor
    :name => 'HelpDesk',
    :description => 'HelpDesk is a mySaaS extension to add basic tickets support for your SaaS.'

    # this is the name of the sub-folders in your mySaaS project where these files will be copied.
    # examples: `p/helpdesk/`, `cli/helpdesk/`, `lib/helpdesk/`, `views/helpdesk/`, etc. 
    :folder => 'helpdesk',
)
```

The files `app.rb` and `config.rb` of each extension are copied to the folder `~/code/mysaas/.extensions/heldesk/`

The `app.rb` file has the path for all the website screens and access points.

The `config.rb` have any configurations regarding the extension, like the plans and prices of a new app.

# 12.3. Versioning

When you write the descriptor of an extension, you can define what is the version of such an extension.

```ruby
BlackStack::Extensions::add(
    # descriptive name and descriptor
    :name => 'chatjs',
    :description => 'Javascript widget to add messaging boxes to your apps.'

    # this is the name of the sub-folders where its files will be stored.
    # examples: `p/helpdesk`, `cli/helpdesk`, `lib/helpdesk`, `views/helpdesk`, etc. 
    :folder => 'chatjs',

    # define version with format <mayor>.<minor>.<revision>
    :version => '1.2.54',
)
```

**MySaaS** uses [BlackStack Deployer](https://github.com/leandrosardi/blackstack-deployer) for automatically push your source code to GitHub and tag the new version, so it is easy to pull a specific version later.

```ruby
BlackStack::Extensions::push
```

## 12.4. Dependenices

When you write the descriptor of an extension, you can define what other extensions are needed to run such an extension.

```ruby
BlackStack::Extensions::add(
    # descriptive name and descriptor
    :name => 'HelpDesk',
    :description => 'HelpDesk is a mySaaS extension to add basic tickets support for your SaaS.'

    # this is the name of the sub-folders where its files will be stored.
    # examples: `p/helpdesk`, `cli/helpdesk`, `lib/helpdesk`, `views/helpdesk`, etc. 
    :folder => 'helpdesk',

    # define version with format <mayor>.<minor>.<revision>
    :dependencies => [
        { :extension => :chatjs, :version => '1.2.54' },
    ],
)
```

Internally, **MySaaS** uses [BlackStack Deployer](https://github.com/leandrosardi/blackstack-deployer) clone the GitHub repository of the extension, and pull the version that your extension is requesting.

```ruby
BlackStack::Extensions::clone :chatjs
BlackStack::Extensions::pull :chatjs, '1.2.54'
```

Dependencies are clonned/pulled into working path, unless your define a specific folder to store such a depenency.

```ruby
    # define version with format <mayor>.<minor>.<revision>
    :dependencies => [
        { :extension => :chatjs, :version => '1.2.54', :path => '~/code/chatjs-1.2.54' },
    ],
```

Use the `:path` parameter when you need to work with many different versions for any reason.
As example: you neeed the depenency extension `chatjs-1.2.54`, but also you are working out a new verison on other folder.

## 12.5. Adding Extensions as Modules of Your SaaS

Your extension may be shown to the end-user as a module of your platform.

```ruby
BlackStack::Extensions::add(
    # descriptive name and descriptor
    :name => 'HelpDesk',
    :description => 'HelpDesk is a mySaaS extension to add basic tickets support for your SaaS.'

    # this is the name of the sub-folders where its files will be stored.
    # examples: `p/helpdesk`, `cli/helpdesk`, `lib/helpdesk`, `views/helpdesk`, etc. 
    :folder => 'helpdesk',

    # add this extension as a new service
    :app => {
        # what is the section to add this extension in either the top-bar, the footer, the dashboard.
        :section => 'Software Services',
        # what are the screens to add in the leftbar
        :leftbaricons => [
            # add an icon with the label "dashboard`, with the icon `icon-dashboard`, and poiting to the scren `helpdesk/dashboard`. 
            { :label => 'dashboard', :icon => :dashboard, :screen => :dasbhaoard, },
            # add an icon with the label "tickets`, with the icon `icon-envelope`, and poiting to the scren `helpdesk/tickets`. 
            { :label => 'tickets', :icon => :envelope, :screen => :dasbhaoard, },

        ],
    },
)
```

## 12.6. Adding Extensions as Settings Screens

Your extension may add screens to the accounts settings.

```ruby
BlackStack::Extensions::add(
    # descriptive name and descriptor
    :name => 'Infoicing and Payments Processing (I2P)',
    :description => 'I2P is a mySaaS extension for end-user creating invoices and show consumption transactions into your SaaS.'

    # this is the name of the sub-folders where its files will be stored.
    # examples: `p/helpdesk`, `cli/helpdesk`, `lib/helpdesk`, `views/helpdesk`, etc. 
    :folder => 'i2p',

    # add some screens of this extension to the account settings of your SaaS.
    :setting_screens => {
        # add a link in section `Billing & Finances` of the `/settings` screen, with a caption `Invoices`, and linking to the screen `/settings/invoices`. The source code of the screen `/settings/invoices` is copied from the file `/vews/invoices.erb` in the extension's folder. 
        { :section => 'Billing & Finances', :label => 'Invoices', :screen => 'invoices' }
        { :section => 'Billing & Finances', :label => 'PayPal Subscriptions', :screen => 'subscriptions' }
        { :section => 'Billing & Finances', :label => 'Transactions', :screen => 'transactions' }
    },
)
```

## 12.7. Expanding the Account Storage Folder

Each account has a dedicated [storage](./1.accounts-management.md#17-account-files-storage) where to store private files.

Each exgension can add some specific folders to for the accounts storage.

```ruby
BlackStack::Extensions::add(
    # descriptive name and descriptor
    :name => 'HelpDesk',
    :description => 'HelpDesk is a mySaaS extension to add basic tickets support for your SaaS.'

    # this is the name of the sub-folders where these files will be stored.
    # examples: `p/helpdesk`, `cli/helpdesk`, `lib/helpdesk`, `views/helpdesk`, etc. 
    :folder => 'helpdesk',

    # add a folder to the storage where user can upload files and screenshots with his/her tickets.
    :storage_folders => ['files', 'screenshots']
)
```
